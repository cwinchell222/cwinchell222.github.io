        <h3> MeteoriteDataFilter Project 1.2</h3>
        <h4> <small>COMP-390 Software Engineering: Fall 2023 </small></h4>
    </div>
    <p>- This program allows you filter and output NASA meteorite data contained from a text file. The data in the text file must be organized in a specific format: Required format: </p>
    <p>--- Each line of the text file must descibe a single meteorite data entry </p>
    <p>--- For each meteorite line there must be 11 data fields seperated by tabs </p>
    <p>----ex: name id nametype recclass mass (g) fall year reclat reclong GeoLocation States Counties </p>
    <p>- Required Libraries: </p>
    <p>--- pytest </p>
    <p>--- datetime</p>
    <p>--- xlwt </p>
    <p>- To Run: </p>
    <p>-- 1. Run the main() program</p>
    <p>-- 2. User will be prompted to enter a valid text file</p>
    <p>-- 3. User will be prompted for how they wish to edit the file (ex. read, write, append)</p>
    <p>-- 4. Next the user will be prompted to filter the meteorite data by mass or year</p>
    <p>-- 5. Depending on the selection, the user will be prompted to enter a upper and lower bound limit for mass; or by the year the meteorite fell</p>
    <p>-- 6. Finally user will be prompted for their desired output option:</p>
    <p>--- To the terminal </p>
    <p>--- To a text file </p>
    <p>--- To an excel file </p>

        <h3> MatrixMultiplication-JavaSockets  </h3>
        <h4> <small>COMP-462 Distributed Systems: Spring 2023 </small></h4>
    </div>
    <p>- Uses JavaSockets module to establish a client-server connection on local ports </p>
    <p>- Client Side:  </p>
    <p>--- Generates 2 sqaure matrices based on cmd line argument, populated with random ints between 0 and 100. </p>
    <p>--- Sends both matrix objects to server.</p>
    <p>--- Recieves product of both matrices and displays result to screen.</p>
    <p>- Server Side:</p>
    <p>--- Accepts both matrix objects and generates a third matrix of the same size populated with the product of matrix1 and matrix2.</p>
    <p>--- Returns product matrix to client side connection.</p>
    <p>--- terminates connection after returning final calculation.</p>
    <p>- To Run: </p>
    <p>--- 1. TERMINAL ONE: run the GreetServer.java program, java GreetServer.java: this will begin listening for the GreetClient.java initial message.</p>
    <p>--- 2. TERMNIAL TWO: run the GreetClient.java program as Java GreetClient.java (size of square array): Generates both matrices and establishes connection with server.</p>
